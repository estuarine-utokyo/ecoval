Installation
============

You will need to use Conda to use ecoVal. The first step is to create a new environment::

   $ conda env create --name ecoval -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmlmodelling/ecoval/main/ecoval.ymlâ€‹
   $ conda activate ecoval

Once you have done that, install the development version from GitHub::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/pmlmodelling/ecoval.git
